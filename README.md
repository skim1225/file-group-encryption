# file-group-encryption

Goal:
1. Design an efficient cryptographic scheme that provides confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. An implementation of this Secure Group File sharing system must enable a sender to encrypt and sign a file to be sent to an specified group of recipients (each of them should provide their public key to the sender). Any of the receivers must  verify the senderâ€™s signature and then decrypt the encrypted file.

2. Write a bash/shell script that implements the cryptographic scheme you design. You can assume a number of group members of 4 (1 sender, 3 receivers), and that all group members have their own ECC  private-public key pairs and have previously shared their public key with each other.  

3. Also, you need to use Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC), which does not provide asymmetric encryption/decryption, and hence, the cryptosystem requires the use of a combination of ECC and DH (ECDH Links to an external site.) . Your cryptosystem needs to create one cryptographic envelope for each receiver, and the encryption method used needs to ensure that the key used is coming from a key derivation function (pbkdf2, argon2, scrypt,  ...), which takes the ECDH as seed [Piazza post based on class presentation Links to an external site.]. 

4. Your sender's side script must output just one zip file  (Use the zip command to zip multiple files together) and your receiver's side must output the plaintext file only if a valid private key is provided and the signature verification is correct (Must be an exact copy of the initial plaintext file). Ensure that you delete any files created during intermediate steps of the sender/receiver process. Make sure that you use key sizes and algorithms that are appropriate for security today.
